                        As soon as you stake your tokens, they are blocked. The blocking period depends on the specific level at which you are stuck: 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year.<br>
                        If the initial period of your staking has ended, but you have not chosen a new one, then every time you register for IDO, the system will block your pool for 1 month.<br>
                        You can take (unstake) ahead of the blocking period, but with a 25% fee. Or wait for the end of the staking period.

                        No. You are entitled to any IDO as long as your $ARTR remains in the stake. The amount of your steak will correspond to the current amount in the level system.
